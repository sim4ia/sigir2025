## tl;dr

Interactive and engaging Workshop on Simulations for Information Access at [SIGIR 2025](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/) in Padua, Italy. 

## About

Simulations in information access (IA) have recently gained interest, as shown by various tutorials and workshops around that topic. 
Simulations can be key contributors to central IA research and evaluation questions, especially around interactive settings when real users are unavailable, or their participation is impossible due to ethical reasons. In addition, simulations in IA can help contribute to a better understanding of users, reduce complexity of evaluation experiments, and improve reproducibility. 

Building on recent developments in methods and toolkits, the second iteration of our Sim4IA workshop aims to again bring together researchers and practitioners to form an interactive and engaging forum for discussions on the field's future perspectives. An additional aim is to plan an upcoming TREC/CLEF campaign.

## Workshop Goals

To understand how and whether the evaluation of information access technology can truly benefit from simulating user interactions, not only tools and frameworks are critical, but a multidisciplinary discussion and mutual understanding among the broad and sometimes conflicting perspectives is necessary. Simulations have to be aligned to the real-world settings of users and their complex information needs, contexts, and requirements. This workshop should serve as a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners. Additionally, this workshop aims to provide a much-needed forum for the community to discuss the emerging challenges when applying (user) simulations to evaluate information access systems in simulation-based shared tasks. Our goals are to:

* item Continue our series of workshops to generate an open conversation about possible future scenarios, applications, and methods to include simulations in the evaluation of IA systems;
* Provide a forum at SIGIR to discuss the pressing and emerging issues the IR community faces, and how simulations can help to overcome these;
* Develop and advertise the idea of organizing a TREC/CLEF campaign that includes simulations as a core element;
* Test an initial setting for two (micro) shared tasks designed around two IA use cases that might form the basis for the aforementioned TREC/CLEF campaign.
